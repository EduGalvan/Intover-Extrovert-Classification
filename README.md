# Intover-Extrovert-Classification
In this repositroy we try to guess the personality type based on the last 50 post of 9000 people, according on the Myers-Briggs personality type.

We use NLP methodologies to tokenize and analyze the data and RNN to predict the personality. A wordcloud is also created so we can give some explanaiton of how the neuran network can predict the personalities, and some differences are observed in the frecuency of th ewords used.

With this model we achieve an accuracy of 80%.

The dataset used comes from kaggle: (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/mbti-type)
